This page supplies links and bibliographic references to online and printed images of manuscripts of *Piers Plowman*.
Manuscripts are listed in alphabetical order by location and shelfmark.
Sigla are those of the [*Piers Plowman Electronic Archive*](http://piers.chass.ncsu.edu/).

I aim to list all full facsimiles.
For manuscripts not yet reproduced in full in a publicly distributed facsimile, I note representative images of individual leaves.
In such cases preference is given to [IIIF](https://iiif.io/) sources and digital reproductions served out by the holding institution.
Web sources are linked directly.
For printed sources, links are to bibliographic details hosted on [Zotero]({{ page.zotero }}).
Illustrations published in *The Yearbook of Langland Studies* are referenced by volume and page.

Corrections and additions [are welcome](/piers-pictures/about).

**Note**: the British Library's collection of digitised manuscripts went offline in October 2023 as a consequence of the [cyberattack](https://www.bl.uk/cyber-incident/).
Links will be updated as access is restored.
